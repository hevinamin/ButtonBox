# ButtonBox
An 8-button button box used for racing simulators including Assetto Corsa, iRacing, and much more!


Hello! This is a project I made for myself due to running out of options on my wheel.

Currently, I use a Moza GS V2P Wheel, which is a phenomenal piece of machinery, but some of the buttons and their labels aren't anything that I need, and sometimes I see myself running out of room.

I did some research, and stumbled upon the possibility of converting an Arduino Pro Micro into an HID device that my simulators such as Assetto Corsa, iRacing, and Assetto Corsa Compitizione, and Le Mans Ultimate can use.

This is all done using 8 momentary buttons, a Pro Micro board, and a breadboard, as well as some clever code.

I do not claim ownership for the code and you guys can use it as you see fit. Some adjustments can be made to better fit your needs!

You will need to install the Joystick library from the following link: https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary .
In Arduino IDE:
Go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library
Find your downloaded .zip from the link and import it.

I HIGHLY recommend getting a new 1 foot to 3 feet data cable, either USB-C or Micro USB depending on your Pro Micro manufacturer. However, any old data cable that connects to your PC and Pro Micro works! 

Hope you have fun!
